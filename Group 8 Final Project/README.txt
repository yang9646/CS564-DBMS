READ ME:

To use this project, you must create a local project in MySQL called gameproject.
	- Use the Teamproject.sql script to set up the 4 tables
	- Read the data into each table from vgsales.csv
	- Initialize all stored procedures in MySQL
	- Run updateRank to generate the ranks for each game (optional, can be done in the GUI)

Next, you must be running JDK 14+ (maybe lower, but this was developed in 14)
	- JDBC aka mysql-connector must be installed in the project
	- JavaFX must be installed
	- SceneBuilder is recommended to view the fxml file

Next, you must navigate to the SQLConnection.java file and enter your username and password for your instance of gameProject

Finally, you may now run the Java Project.
